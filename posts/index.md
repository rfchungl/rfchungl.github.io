This is a repository to showcase skills learned through academic, work, hobby, and internships.

These projects showcase skills that range from data mining, data analysis, visualization, Excel, SQL, Python, 
database management to business cases.

Most of the projects have sumaries and are explained in a way that everybody could understand but it may also contain 
high level written details. 

If you are curious about one of my projects, please shoot me an email at rfchungl@uark.edu.
