As a professional, it's important to have a portfolio that showcases your skills and expertise. That's why I've created a repository that displays my academic, work, hobby, and internship projects. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in a range of areas, including data mining, data analysis, visualization, Excel, SQL, Python, database management, and business cases.

My portfolio contains project summaries that are explained in a way that's easy for everyone to understand, but also includes detailed information for those who want to delve deeper. By exploring my portfolio, you can gain a better understanding of my abilities and how they could benefit your organization.

Whether you're looking for a data analyst, business analyst, or simply analyst, my portfolio showcases my adaptability and versatility. I'm confident that my skills and experience can make a positive impact on any project or organization.

If you're interested in learning more about one of my projects, please don't hesitate to contact me at rfchungl@gmail.com. I'm always happy to discuss my work and how I can help your team succeed.
