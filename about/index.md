Greetings! 

My name is Ruben Chung and I am a data/business analyst who is passionate about leveraging data to solve complex business problems. With a background in business, including hands-on experience working in my family's business, I hold both an undergraduate degree in Supply Chain Management and a master's degree in Applied Business Analytics from the University of Arkansas.

As a data enthusiast, I have honed my skills in various areas including ETL processes, data visualization, data mining, advanced Excel, SQL, and Python. Furthermore, my extensive domain expertise in sales, management, operations, transportation, and customer service has equipped me to bring unique insights to any project.

If you're interested in seeing some of the exciting projects I've worked on, head over to my projects page. 

Currently based in Fayetteville, Arkansas, I work as a Junior Business Analyst in the Walton College of Business at the [University of Arkansas][1]. 

I'm thrilled to share my passion for data with you and I hope you enjoy browsing my portfolio.
