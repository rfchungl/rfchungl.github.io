Hi, my name is Ruben Chung and I am an aspiring data/business analyst with a background in business as having direct exposure working in my family business.  
<br>
I hold an undergraduate degree in Supply Chain Management and a master's degree in Applied Business Analytics both from the University of Arkansas. I enjoy working with data to help the organization answer business questions.  
<br>
I have experience that ranges from ETL processes, data visualization, data mining, advanced Excel, and Python. In addition, my domain expertise also involves sales, management, operations, transportation, and customer service. For more details on all that, check out [projects](/posts/).  
<br>
I currently live in Fayetteville, Arkansas. I work as a Junior Business Analyst in the Walton College of Business at the [University of Arkansas][1].
